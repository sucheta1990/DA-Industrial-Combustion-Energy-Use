# DA-Industrial-Combustion-Energy-Use
To Analyse and draw the insights From the Combustion of Energy in Industries in the MECS Regions
and analyse the comsuption of energy by various industries in MMBTU and GW_ht units in MECS regions
Given the total energy combustion use of the faciltites in the MECS region.Need to analyse the units of fuel  used by the regions in the MECS.
which facility used the highest units of energy .
Unit trend from 1950-2022 with respect to GWht energy.
To draw the insights on this  comsuption of energy its uses and adverse effects
